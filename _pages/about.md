## About me

I am a quantum physicist \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fgjI_voAAAAJ&hl=en}{working} at the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter physics. Areas of active research include
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum error correction (Dynamical error correcting codes, Machine learning applications to decoders, QLDPC codes etc)
    \item Quantum simulation (Holographic simulation of tensor networks, Efficient fermionic encoding schemes)
    \item Exotic states of matter (Fractons, Topological order, Symmetry protected topological phases)
\end{itemize}

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the \href{https://qmi.ubc.ca/}{The Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute at UBC}.
